<p id="meetMax">My passion for computer programming began at the age of 15 on the first windows flip phone.<br> 
I was able to locate the hex codes to change the color of the specific attributes of the device. <br>
I was so enthused by this I began studying and practicing HTML and CSS. and of course, <br>
I was one of those guys with a really unique myspace page. Initially, <br>
I was convinced that web development and programming was too fun that <br>
it could not possibly be a serious career, so I pursued a medical degree. <br>
I left that path to seek employment due to low drive and passion for it. <br>
A few years later I found that computer science was an extremely important degree and it is indeed serious. <br>
I immedietly quit my dead end job to persue the degree of my dreams, <br>
graduated, and get to work in the feild I am absolutly crazy about.</p>
